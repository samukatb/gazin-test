          Welcome to my website! My name is Samuel Lorenil Kesbaumer da Silva,
          and this site was created as part of a fullstack job application for
          Gazin, using NestJS and VueJS. I'm excited to showcase my skills and
          demonstrate my passion for web development.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-2">
          This website is a test project that showcases my ability to create a
          responsive and user-friendly interface integrated with an API, as well
          as my proficiency in using modern web frameworks. I believe that
          building user-friendly web applications is essential to providing a
          positive user experience, and I strive to achieve this in all my
          projects.
        </p>
