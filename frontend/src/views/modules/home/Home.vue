      Welcome to my website! This site was created as part of a fullstack job
      application for Gazin, using NestJS and VueJS. I'm excited to showcase my
      skills and demonstrate my passion for web development.

      This website is a test project that showcases my ability to create a
      application integrated with an API, as well as my proficiency in using
      modern web frameworks.
